# Road Data Time Series Prediction

Hi! I've used *Decision Tree Classifier* from *sklearn* library in order to predict the parameters 9 to 13 for all sections for year 10.


## About the dataset used

The dataset consists of data of various sections of a road collected by a company. Each section's data is spread over a time span of 10 years, collected at regular interval of 1 year. 13 different parameters regarding the road have been collected each year, for every section of the road.

Using the above mentioned model, I've predicted the values corresponding to parameters 9 to 13 of 10th year of each section

## RMSE

RMSE for Parameter 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 respectively:-
